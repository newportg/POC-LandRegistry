# 2, Architectural Constraints

## Architectural Goals

Integration Goals for Knight Frank’s Systems with UK GOV Land Registry:

* Secure transfer of property information with Land Registry.
* Ability to receive documentary property information.


## Architectural Principles

The proposed pattern architecture aligns to our current Group Technology Principles as follows:

| # | Principle                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | RAG   |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1 | Cloud-First and Microsoft-Considered Strategy                        | This service, like all services defined are written to take advantages of cloud-first design, and are only cloud vendor specific where they need to be.                                                   | <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span> |
| 2 | Design in a modular way and think of re-use                          | The service integration pattern follows previously defined services, and shares many components.                                                                                                          |  <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span>|
| 3 | High Cohesion and Low Coupling – Favour Asynchronous Communication​  | This service utilises a service-bus architecture, decoupling it from specific client applications, enabling it to be used by all.                                                                         |  <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span>|
| 4 | Software Should be Verifiable                                        | This service has been designed with the view that all components will be highly testable, and fully meet the requirements of a CI/CD strategy.                                                            |  <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span>|
| 5 | Think Global, Build Local                                            | This service has been specified to be location agnostic.                                                                                                                                                  |  <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span>|
| 6 | Configuration over Customisation                                     | Any cloud service must facilitate run-time behaviour (configuration) changes via a self-serve administrator portal. This SAD includes the resources to enable this capability by default                  |  <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span>|
| 7 | Build with Privacy-as-Default with a risk-based approach to security | The pattern architecture will mandate a standards-based approach to resource authentication (Managed Identity), user authorisation (role-based access control) and both user and system activity auditing |  <span style="    background-color:lightGreen;">Green</span>|

## Architecture Constraints

* External generation of property inspection material should follow Knight Franks security and access rules concerning all clients, and especially clients with restricted access, such as high net worth and clients with NDA's
* Tenancy, Occupier Details and Property Inspection material should not persist on external sites longer than is necessary to complete the task.
  * This is to avoid possible security leaks
  * Minimise storage costs
* Access to the service will follow current approved security and access rules.
  * Managed Identity to provide resource access.
  * User Identity optional, as calling systems will have already authenticated the user.
    * If User Identity is passed then it should be validated.
  * User Identity to satisfy audit.
